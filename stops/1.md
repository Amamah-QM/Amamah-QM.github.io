Cleopatra was the last pharaoh of ancient Egypt and is known for her beauty, intelligence, and political savvy. She was born in 69 BC and ruled Egypt from 51 BC until her death in 30 BC. Cleopatra was involved in a romantic relationship with Julius Caesar and later with Mark Antony, which ultimately led to her downfall. She was also known for her knowledge of languages and her efforts to maintain Egypt's independence from Rome.

## Cleopatra

> Welcome to the first meeting point, where we explore people, places or moments of coming together, and the ripples of ideas that they generate. Here we look at the legacy of histories and stories: what stories do we remember, and which histories are forgotten?

The tragic love story of Antony and Cleopatra played out only a few years before Amanirenas, Queen of the Kingdom of Kush (in present-day Sudan and southern Egypt), victoriously led her armies against Rome. 

One story has been celebrated and reinterpreted endlessly in the West - from Shakespeare to Hollywood - while one has been overlooked. 

This prejudice is embodied in differing Western conceptions of Egypt and Nubia, and Mediterranean versus African civilisations. Qatar is supporting excavations in Sudan, shedding light on these overlooked histories, and reasserting the importance of Kush and other African civilisations in the archaeological record.
